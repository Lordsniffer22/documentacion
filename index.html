        <h1>Documentation</h1>
        <p>This page provides a brief overview of our Game changing, State-of-the-Art Advertising Platform for TikTok.</p>

        <h2>A Note from the Founder</h2>
        <p>We all acknowledge that there is a huge number of people and businesses on TikTok than on any other platforms at the present time. In a business atmosphere, this just simply translates to more eye balls available on the social platform!<br>It has been unfortunate that there exists no direct way to expose business products and services to the huge audience tiktok holds. <br>-That's the No.1 reason why Adskit (Formerly "TikTok Spaces") comes in to solve the problem. Sounds perfect, right?</p>

        <h2>Getting Started</h2>
        <p>To get started on Adskit as a publisher(Content Creator), you need to sign up first.<br><br>Advertisers <b>do not</b> have to create any accounts with Adskit (You are free to place your Ads directly from any Telegram Account). </p>
        <h2>Commands</h2>
        <p>Make use of these commands while interracting with our <b><a href="http://t.me/adskitBot">Telegram Bot</a></b></p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>/start</strong>: Initiate a conversation with Adskit bot.</li>
            <li><strong>/help</strong>: This will show you the usage guide and a list of available commands you can use in case you forget.</li>
            <li><strong>/register</strong>: This will open up a registration form for you to sign up as a Publisher/Content Creator</li>
            <li><strong>/done</strong>: Send this command only if you are done making a tiktok video and you want to submit it for review & then get paid.</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Hot Keys</h2>
        <p>Our Bot is so sensitive to your messages. When doing some tasks like submitting a proof of payment or sending your Advert content, Make use of these hot Keys.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>#paid</strong>: Use this as a starting line/word of your photo caption. <br>The next line should also contain the <b>Order ID</b> the Bot gave you on submitting Your Ad content. </li>
            <li><strong>#Adcontent</strong>: Use this hot key as a starting word/line of your Ad content. If the Advert is Text only, It should start with <b><i>#Adcontent</i></b>. The same still applies to photo/video captions.</li>
        </ul>
        See an example where a Hot Key was used to submit a proof of payment below:
                <!-- Add the image here -->
                <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Lordsniffer22/fed/main/example.jpg" alt="Adskit: Example of payment proof" style="width: 90%; max-width: 200px; display: block; margin: 20px auto;">
        <h2>Adskit ID</h2>
        <p>We introduced the use of Adskit ID's which are the unique identifiers of each tiktoker who registered with us and is approved. <br>Adskit ID for each tiktoker is displayed in the TikTok Spaces channel on telegram. <strong> A tiktoker has to place this ID on their Bio details and should stay visible. </strong>It allows advertisers be sure of what they are paying for.</p>

        <h2>How the platform Works</h2>
        <p>Our Platform uses a friendly bot that manages both a TikTok content creator and Advertisers.<br><strong>== [Advertisers]</strong> to <strong>[AdsKit]</strong> & finally to <strong> [TikToker] ==</strong><br><br><b>#1.</b> An advertiser Requests to have his/her advert placed in a TikToker's next video. The bot inboxes him/her with the instructions on how to submit the Advert to Adskit.<br><br><b>#2.</b> Adskit reviews the Advert upon recieving it and if the advert meets the standards, an Ad placement request is sent to the Tiktoker informing him/her of the deal.<br><br><b>#3.</b> A user has the right to accept or Decline the Ad placement request. If he/she accepts to take the deal, the TikToker is expected to make a video in any way he likes, making sure the Advert is included in the video.<br><br><b>#4.</b>  The Tiktoker then submits a link to the already uploaded video to Adskit. If we confirm the advert is there as the advertiser asked, we then make a payment to the tiktoker's account.</p>
        <h3>Attention TikTokers</h3>
        <p>Attract more advertisers by Adding your Adskit ID to your tiktok profile Bio section. Soon we are making it a requirement for account approval. <strong>Make sure it stays Visible</strong> </p>
        <p>Deleting the video where an advert exists afterwards will lead to permanent termination of your <b>Adskit ID</b> and your tiktok account will never be accepted here anymore!</p>
        <h3>Public Channel</h3>
        <p>We are making use of our new Telegram channel named <a href="https://t.me/adskity">TikTok Spaces‚ú®.</a><br>In this channel, Advertisers can find various TikTok creators who are registered with us. From this, Ad placement requests can be initiated by the Advertisers against any Ad space of their choice.</p>

        <h2>Disclaimer</h2>
        <p>This platform is <strong>NOT</strong> at any point managed/owned by ByteDance Ltd, a Chineese company that owns TikTok.<br><br><i>Further more, Adskit (Formerly "TikTok Spaces") will never ask for your Bank Passwords, Card CVV, OTP among others through any private chats. </i><br><br>Immediately Report to us incase of anything.
